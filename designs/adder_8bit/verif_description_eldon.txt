Please act as a professional SystemVerilog testbench designer.

 

Implement a SystemVerilog UVM 2020-2.0 compliant testbench for an 8-bit adder adder_8bit.

Module name:
    adder_8bit

Input ports:
    a[7:0]: 8-bit input operand A.
    b[7:0]: 8-bit input operand B.
    cin: Carry-in input.

Output ports:
    sum[7:0]: 8-bit output representing the sum of A and B.
    cout: Carry-out output.

Use an active agent. Create the sequencer in the agent. In the test, start the sequence on the sequencer.

Use the sequence item below.

sequence_item name:
    adder_8bit_transaction

members:
    rand bit [7:0] a
    rand bit [7:0] b
    rand bit cin
    bit [7:0] sum
    bit cout

Use the existing virtual interface named adder_8bit_if that is placed into the configuration database for the driver and monitor Only include the class based elements in the adder_8bit_pkg.sv.

Include the appropiate uvm_object_util and uvm_component_util macros in every UVM class.

Use initialize all uvm objects with the appropriate uvm constructor.

All uvm classes shall implement their appropriate new method.

Virtual interface is already declared and set in in the top module.
